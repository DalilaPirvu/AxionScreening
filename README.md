# AxionScreening

Model signal from axion-induced patchy dark screening of the CMB.

This code was used to produce the numerical data and figures for the work of C. Mondino et al. arXiv:2405.08059

The file contains a modified version of the code `hmvec', as it was used in our analysis.
For the original version, see <<https://github.com/simonsobs/hmvec>>.

The dependencies are the same as for hmvec.
